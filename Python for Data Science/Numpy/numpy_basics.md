# What is NumPy? 
**NumPy** short for Numerical Python is a python library 
used for **Working with numbers** and **performing mathematical operations** on large data sets.

It provides a powerful array objects which are more faster and memory effecient then regular python lists.

## Why use NumPy instead of Lists?
- Python Lists is comparitively slower then NumPy
- Consumes more memory
- Performs operations in loope meanwhile NumPy does it in one line
- Python can store mixed data type, while NumPy only one data type

## Key Performance: 

- **Performance**: NumPy is more effecient then Python lists when handling large amout of data
- **Vectorized Operations**: Using NumPy we can easily perform operations on while arrays directly
- **Multidimensional Arrays**: Allows us to work with Ndimensional arrays
- **Useful functions**: Comes with many math functions like `mean`, `sum` etc

## Applications of NumPy
NumPy is almost used in every field that involves numbers or data.
1. Data Science & Machine Learnign : To preprocess the data
2. Image processing: Images can be treated as arrays
3. Computer Vision: Effecient for matrix operations used in transformations, filtering, etc.
