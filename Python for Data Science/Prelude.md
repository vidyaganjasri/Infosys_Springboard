### 🐍 About Python

Python is an **open-source**, **general-purpose programming language**. It supports both **structured** and **object-oriented** styles of programming. Python can be used to develop a wide range of applications, including:

- 🌐 Web applications  
- 📊 Data analytics  
- 🤖 Machine learning applications  
- 🛠️ Many more...

### 🧮 Python Data Types & Structures

Python provides various **data types** and **data structures** for storing and processing data:

- **Single Value Data Types**:
  - `int` — Integer numbers
  - `float` — Decimal numbers
  - `str` — Strings (text)
  - `bool` — Boolean values (`True`/`False`)

- **Group Data Structures**:
  - `list` — Ordered, mutable collection
  - `tuple` — Ordered, immutable collection
  - `dict` — Key-value pairs
  - `set` — Unordered collection of unique elements

### 📚 Python Libraries

Python offers a wide range of **libraries** and **built-in functions** that support **rapid application development**.

- Libraries are collections of **pre-written code** for specific tasks.
- They help eliminate the need to **rewrite code from scratch**.

Some commonly used libraries include:

- `NumPy` — Numerical computing
- `Pandas` — Data manipulation and analysis
- `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` — Data visualization
- `Scikit-learn` — Machine learning
- `Flask`, `Django` — Web development

---

Python is widely popular because of its **simplicity**, **versatility**, and **community support**.
