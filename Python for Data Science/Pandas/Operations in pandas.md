## üîç Understanding Filtering in Pandas

Filtering means selecting only the rows that match a condition.

---

### üß† Basic Syntax

```python
df[condition]
```
You give a condition, and pandas returns the rows that match it.

---
## Problem statement : Retrieve details of all the cars built in year 72.
```python
df.loc[df['model_year'] == 72 ].head()
```

## Problem statement : Retrieve details of all the cars built in Japan having 6 cylinders

```python
df.loc[(df['origin'] == 'japan') & (df['cylinders'] == 6)]
```

## Masking Operation

The masking operation replaces values where the condition is True.
```python
DataFrame.mask(condition, value_to_put)
```
If cond is true, it replaces the value that we provide, else keeps the original 
value 

### For Example: 
teacher does not want to reveal the marks of the students who have failed.
the cond is that if the marks <33, then marks of stu has to be replaced with 'Fail'

```

## Broadcasting operation
If we want to make chagnes to all the values in the data

```python
new_marks = marks_df + 5
new_marks
```

## Aggregation Operations in Pandas

Aggregation operation is used to aggregate using one or more operations over the specified axis.

```python
#Using list comprehension to get the numerical columns
list1 = [col for col in df.columns if df[col].dtype in ['float', 'int64']]
df[list1].agg(['min', 'max'])
```

## Grouping operations in Pandas

to know the number of cars manufactured 

```python
df.groupby(['model_year']).count()[['name']]
```
df.groupby(['model_year']).count()[['name']]

---

## Concatinating DataFrames 

Want to combine the marks of students

```python
marks_A = {'Chemistry': [67,90,66,32], 
        'Physics': [45,92,72,40],  
          }
marks_A_df = pd.DataFrame(marks_A, index = ['Subodh', 'Ram', 'Abdul', 'John'])
marks_B = {'Chemistry': [72,45,60,98], 
        'Physics': [78,34,72,95],  
          }
marks_B_df = pd.DataFrame(marks_B, index = ['Nandini', 'Zoya', 'Shivam', 'James'])
```

```python
pd.concat([marks_A_df,marks_B_df], sort = False)
```

## Pivot Table 

What does the pivot table do?
Imagine you have a big table of cars. Each row is a car, and each car has:

A year

Some numbers like horsepower, weight, mileage, etc.

Now, you want to know:

‚ÄúFor each year, what is the average horsepower, weight, mileage, etc. of all cars in that year?‚Äù

‚úÖ That‚Äôs exactly what the pivot table does!
You just tell it:

index='Year' ‚Üí group the cars by year

aggfunc='mean' ‚Üí and take the average of the numbers

So yes ‚Äî for each year, you get one row, and in that row you see the average value of each column.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Suppose df is the DataFrame
pd.pivot_table(df, index='Year')

```
