## üîç Understanding Filtering in Pandas

Filtering means selecting only the rows that match a condition.

---

### üß† Basic Syntax

```python
df[condition]
```
You give a condition, and pandas returns the rows that match it.

## Problem statement : Retrieve details of all the cars built in year 72.
```python
df.loc[df['model_year'] == 72 ].head()
```

## Masking Operation

The masking operation replaces values where the condition is True.
```python
DataFrame.mask(condition, value_to_put)
```
If cond is true, it replaces the value that we provide, else keeps the original 
value 

### For Example: 
teacher does not want to reveal the marks of the students who have failed.
the cond is that if the marks <33, then marks of stu has to be replaced with 'Fail'
